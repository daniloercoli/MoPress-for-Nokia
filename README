MoPress for Nokia allows you to write simple posts and manage comments of your WordPress blog. Both WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress (2.7 or higher) sites are supported.

Some Widget applications may not work on early device software versions (firmware) on some devices. To ensure this Widget application functions properly, it is recommended that your device is updated with the latest device software by using Nokia Software Updater.
